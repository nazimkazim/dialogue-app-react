  "Scott Morrison has apologised for going on holiday while Australia is in the grip of an extended bushfire crisis and a record-breaking heatwave In a statement on Friday morning the prime minister explained he had brought forward his leave with his family due to the need to travel to Japan and India in January “I deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,” Morrison said Morrison later confirmed the holiday was in Hawaii, seeking to explain the trip’s secrecy by suggesting he had tried to give his daughters “a bit of a surprise” despite several reporters stating the prime minister’s office had denied reports he was in Hawaii after he and his family had arrived The holiday – which was due to conclude on Monday – will now be cut short, with Morrison expected back in Australia on Saturday";
